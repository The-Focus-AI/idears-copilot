Build a simple webapp that makes it easy to collect ideas.  The user should be able to enter in a new idea, see a list of existing ideas, and be able to "vote" on them which will move them up in the list.  The user should also be able to add notes and to the ideas if they want more detail, including attaching files.  Build it using node that will be deployed in a docker container with a persistent volume for storage, and make sure that everything has unit tests.
